- [ ] Pre-generated E2E test files ready to showcase
- [ ] Test execution screenshots/metrics prepared
- [ ] Timer ready to show time comparisons

---

## üìù **Demo 1: JIRA to Test Cases (5 minutes)**

### **Script:**

"Let me show you how AI transforms a simple JIRA story into comprehensive test cases in under 2 minutes."

### **Actions:**

1. **Show empty JIRA ticket**

   - "Here's a blank story: 'Create Co-applicant Screen'"

2. **Invoke AI agent**

   ```
   "AI, generate acceptance criteria and test cases for a co-applicant screen
   that allows users to add or skip adding a co-applicant to their application"
   ```

3. **Show generated output** (happens in seconds)

   - 5 acceptance criteria
   - 8 comprehensive test scenarios
   - Edge cases included

4. **Highlight time saved**
   - "What just took 90 seconds would take 2-3 hours manually"
   - "And the AI never forgets edge cases"

---

## üé® **Demo 2: Figma to Functional Screen (5 minutes)**

### **Script:**

"Now watch as we turn a Figma design into a fully functional, tested React component."

### **Actions:**

1. **Show Figma design**

   - "Here's our co-applicant screen design"
   - Point out components and interactions

2. **Run AI tool**

   ```bash
   ai-tool create-screen --figma-url="..." --component="CoApplicantScreen"
   ```

3. **Show generated files**

   - Complete React component with:
     - Proper test-ids on every element
     - Accessibility attributes
     - Type safety
     - Storybook documentation

4. **Run Storybook**
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```
   - "From design to working component in 5 minutes"
   - "Previously: 2 days of development"

---

## ü§ñ **Showcase: AI-Generated E2E Test Results (3 minutes)**

### **Script:**

"Now let me show you the incredible results from our AI-generated end-to-end test suite."

### **Actions:**

1. **Present the achievement**

   - "Our AI successfully generated complete E2E tests for the entire OAO application"
   - "13 pages, from application start to approval"
   - Show process diagram: Entry ‚Üí Intro ‚Üí Contact ‚Üí Identity ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Approval

2. **Show the generated code structure**

   ```
   test-library/oao/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EntryScreenPage.ts
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IntroScreenPage.ts
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactInfoScreenPage.ts
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (13 total pages)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entry-screen-flow.spec.ts
   ```

   - "13 Page Object Models generated automatically"
   - "Each with proper test-ids discovered by AI"

3. **Display test code example**

   ```typescript
   // AI-generated test code - ready to use
   test('Complete OAO Application Flow', async ({ page }) => {
     const entryScreen = new EntryScreenPage(page);
     await entryScreen.goto();
     await entryScreen.startApplication();
     // ... continues through all 13 pages
   });
   ```

4. **Show execution metrics**

   - Display test execution screenshot
   - **Key metrics:**
     - ‚è±Ô∏è Generation time: 30 minutes (vs 2 weeks manual)
     - üèÉ Execution time: 18.6 seconds for full journey
     - ‚úÖ Pass rate: 100% on all scenarios
     - üìä Code reduction: 95% less code to maintain

5. **Emphasize the impact**
   - "What traditionally takes 2 weeks, AI completed in 30 minutes"
   - "And it runs in under 20 seconds every time"
   - "Zero manual maintenance required"

---

## üîÑ **Demo 4: Continuous Testing (5 minutes)**

### **Script:**

"But here's the real magic - this runs automatically on every code change."

### **Actions:**

1. **Make a code change**

   - "Let's say we update the contact form"
   - Change a field label

2. **Show GitHub Actions trigger**

   - Push triggers CI/CD
   - AI tests run automatically
   - Results in minutes, not days

3. **Show test results dashboard**

   - Real-time test status
   - Coverage metrics
   - Historical trends

4. **Highlight benefits**
   - "No manual intervention needed"
   - "Catches bugs before they reach production"
   - "Developers get feedback in minutes"

---

## üí° **Key Points to Emphasize**

### **During Each Demo:**

- Show the timer - emphasize speed
- Point out what would be manual work
- Highlight accuracy and completeness
- Show actual code/results

### **Powerful Moments:**

1. When AI generates test cases in 90 seconds
2. When Figma design becomes working code in 5 minutes
3. When showing 13 pages tested in 18.6 seconds
4. When showing $1.6M annual cost savings

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

## üé¨ **Demo Conclusion**

"In just 13 minutes, we've shown you results that traditionally take 3-4 weeks:

- Created comprehensive test cases from requirements (Live Demo)
- Generated a functional screen from design (Live Demo)
- Showcased a complete E2E test suite covering 13 pages
- Demonstrated continuous testing capabilities

This isn't the future - this is working today. The only question is: when do we start?"
