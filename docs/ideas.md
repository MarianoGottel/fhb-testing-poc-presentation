Engineering All Hands

- With all the answers in the world available at your fingertips, then asking the right questions becomes more important than ever.
- What makes you unique is your taste and your vision and your ideas.
- I see the following skills or traits as the most important for this new age we're moving in: curiosity, a high sense of agency, having an opinion and knowing what you stand for, and it's going to be also your ability to let go. Letting go is more important than ever because what happens at the moment with AI shows us that the world is ever changing and that when you're in resistance to change, typically you suffer. It's quite interesting to observe how software engineers, the ones that contributed to driving the change the most over these past decades, are now the ones that seemingly have the hardest time of letting go of their old patterns and ways of doing things. This might come back to some hidden pride that a lot of people are taking in the code they are writing. And this is probably one of the reasons why there's some resistance. When we are in a world where a machine can do everything better and faster and cheaper than the best software engineer in the world> could ever do.
- That doesn't mean that you are not valuable anymore and that you are not able to contribute anything. Quite the contrary. Those who act with a high sense of agency and that are able to zoom out and see the bigger picture, will be able to contribute more and have a larger impact than ever in history.
- We are moving away from the age of engineering towards the age of building. And I strongly believe that everyone who has the traits I mentioned before can become an exceptional builder. What is happening right now is basically the democratization of value creation. Additionally role splits within organizations will gradually resolve, and being a generalist with the willingness to take ownership with a high sense of agency That will be the most important thing that companies will seek and that will bring the most value.
- So ask yourself why you got into software engineering in the first place. What was your motivation? Maybe your motivation for entering the space is different than the one you have right now being in it. For me, I can certainly say it was always about creating. I think that deep inside all of us are creators and being able to do that is something magical and can bring a deep sense of purpose and meaning into one's life. If you ask me what it truly means to be human, then it is our ability to bring ideas to life seemingly out of nowhere and to shape the world in a direction.

“7
Heaven and earth last forever.
Eternal, they transcend birth and death.
The network endures because
it does not live for itself.
The Vibe Coder stays behind,
that is why he’s ahead.
He is detached,
thus at one with all.
Through selfless action
he is perfectly fulfilled.”
