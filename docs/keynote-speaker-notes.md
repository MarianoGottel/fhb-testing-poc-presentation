# Keynote Speaker Notes & Implementation Guide

## Core Message Framework

### The Emotional Journey
1. **Recognition** → "I see you and understand your concerns"
2. **Revelation** → "The world has already changed"
3. **Reframe** → "This is liberation, not threat"
4. **Inspiration** → "You can be more impactful than ever"
5. **Action** → "Here's your first step"

### Key Phrases to Emphasize

**On Resistance**:
- "Your expertise isn't diminished—it's amplified"
- "We're not replacing engineers, we're evolving into builders"
- "The code you write isn't your value—the problems you solve are"

**On Transformation**:
- "AI doesn't make you less valuable, it makes you more powerful"
- "We're moving from 'how' to 'what' and 'why'"
- "10x productivity isn't about working harder—it's about working differently"

**On Banking Context**:
- "We still review every line—we just don't write every line"
- "Compliance requires understanding, not manual typing"
- "Our advantage: We can move fast while others hesitate"

## Delivery Tips

### Pacing
- **Pause** after revealing the reality check
- **Slow down** during the water metaphor
- **Speed up** during the demo to show velocity
- **End strong** with deliberate final words

### Audience Engagement
- Make eye contact during "Why did you become an engineer?"
- Use names of known early adopters as positive examples
- Reference specific First Horizon projects when possible
- Acknowledge the senior engineers specifically

### Handling Resistance
If someone challenges during Q&A:
- "I hear your concern, and it's valid..."
- "Let's explore that together in our AI Masterclass"
- "Your experience is exactly why we need you leading this change"

## Technical Demo Script

```python
# Traditional Way (show typing slowly)
def validate_account(account_data):
    if not account_data.get('account_number'):
        return False
    if len(account_data['account_number']) != 10:
        return False
    if not account_data.get('routing_number'):
        return False
    # ... more validation

# AI Way (show prompt)
"Create a comprehensive account validation function for First Horizon 
that checks account number (10 digits), routing number (9 digits), 
balance requirements, and KYC compliance fields. Include error messages."

# Result appears instantly with full implementation
```

## Post-Keynote Actions

1. **Immediate Follow-up**:
   - Slack message with resources
   - Calendar invite for AI Masterclass
   - Poll results summary

2. **Week 1**:
   - 1:1s with resistant senior engineers
   - First AI pair programming session
   - Share success stories

3. **Week 2-4**:
   - Weekly AI tips in Slack
   - Showcase early Phoenix Project wins
   - Build momentum

## Contingency Plans

**If Met with Silence**:
- "I know this is a lot to process..."
- Share a personal failure/learning story
- Ask a specific person for their thoughts

**If Technical Demo Fails**:
- "Even AI has bad days—just like us"
- Switch to pre-recorded video
- Make it a discussion point about iteration

**If Strong Pushback**:
- "Your concerns are exactly why we need experienced engineers guiding this"
- Redirect to the compliance/quality angle
- Emphasize the "guardian" role

## Success Metrics

Track after presentation:
- Cursor AI usage (week over week)
- Phoenix Project signups
- Slack channel engagement
- AI Masterclass attendance
- Pod velocity improvements

## The Hidden Message

Throughout the presentation, subtly reinforce:
- You are not your code
- Your value is your vision
- Change is growth
- We're doing this together
- First Horizon leads, not follows
