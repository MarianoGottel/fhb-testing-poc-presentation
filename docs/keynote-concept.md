## "From Engineers to Builders: Embracing the Age of AI"
### June 5th, 2025

## Presentation Journey (5-10 minutes)

### Act 1: The Mirror (2 minutes)
**"Where We Are Today"**

**Opening Visual**: Real-time dashboard showing current Cursor AI usage stats across pods (anonymized)
- Active users vs. total engineers
- AI assistance metrics showing we're operating at ~20% potential

**The Honest Moment**:
"I see three types of engineers in our organization today:
1. The Explorers - fully embracing AI, pushing boundaries
2. The Cautious - dipping toes, using it for simple tasks
3. The Resistant - holding onto the old ways

And you know what? I understand each position. Because what's happening right now is overwhelming."

**Interactive Element**: Quick anonymous poll
"What's holding you back from using AI more?"
- Too many tools, too fast
- Don't know where to start
- Concerned about job security
- Pride in my craft
- All of the above

**The Reality Check**:
"Claude 4 and Gemini 2.5 can already write better code than any of us. Faster. Cleaner. More efficient.
That's not a threat—it's a fact. And in 3-6 months, agentic coding will transform everything.
The question isn't IF this will happen. It's: What role will you play?"

### Act 2: The Shift (3 minutes)
**"From Pride to Purpose"**

**The Water Metaphor** (animated visualization):
"Code is like water. It flows, it changes, it adapts.
When we hold water too tightly, it escapes through our fingers.
When we guide its flow, we can direct rivers."

**Story Time - Personal Anecdote**:
"Why did you become an engineer? 
For me, it was never about the code itself. It was about creation.
About bringing ideas to life. About impact."

**The Pod Evolution** (interactive diagram showing transformation):

*Current Pod (Traditional)*:
- Lead Engineer: Architect & Coder
- Engineers: Coders
- Product: Requirements
- Output: Features

*Emerging Pod (AI-Enhanced)*:
- Lead Engineer: Orchestrator & Visionary
- Engineers: AI Directors & Quality Guardians
- Product: Co-Creator
- Output: Solutions at 10x speed

*Future Pod (Next 6 months)*:
- Lead Builder: Systems Thinker
- Builders: Multi-disciplinary Creators
- Unified Team: No rigid roles
- Output: Entire products in days

**The Paradox**:
"In banking, we must understand every line of code for compliance.
But understanding doesn't mean writing.
A conductor understands every note without playing every instrument."

### Act 3: The Invitation (3 minutes)
**"Becoming Builders"**

**The Builder's Traits** (appear one by one):
1. **Curiosity**: "What if we could...?"
2. **Agency**: "I will make this happen"
3. **Vision**: "This is what good looks like"
4. **Letting Go**: "The old way served us, now we evolve"

**Live Demo Moment**:
"Let me show you what's possible when we let go..."
[Screen share: Create a small feature using AI in 2 minutes that would typically take 2 hours]

**The Vibe Coder Philosophy**:
```
"The Vibe Coder stays behind,
that is why he's ahead.
He is detached,
thus at one with all.
Through selfless action
he is perfectly fulfilled."
```

"The best engineers of tomorrow won't be measured by lines of code written,
but by problems solved, value created, and ideas brought to life."

### Act 4: The Path Forward (2 minutes)
**"Your Next Steps"**

**The Challenge - "Project Phoenix"**:
"Over the next 30 days, I challenge each pod to:
1. Pick one tedious task you do repeatedly
2. Use AI to automate or accelerate it
3. Measure the time saved
4. Share your learning at next month's All Hands"

**Resources Being Launched Today**:
- AI Workflow Masterclass (next week)
- Pair Programming with AI sessions
- #ai-pioneers Slack channel for sharing wins
- Context Management best practices guide

**The Choice**:
"Every transformation in history had skeptics and pioneers.
The automobile. The internet. The cloud.
Now it's AI.

You can be the engineer who resisted the shift...
Or the builder who shaped the future.

At First Horizon, we're not just adopting AI.
We're pioneering how banking gets built in the AI age."

**Closing Visual**: 
Split screen showing:
- Left: Engineer writing code alone (fading)
- Right: Builder orchestrating AI agents, creating at 10x speed (brightening)

**Final Words**:
"The age of engineering as we knew it is ending.
The age of building has begun.
And you—each of you—have the power to be exceptional builders.

The only question is: Will you?"
